# Handwritten-Character-Recognition

## Project Description
Creating a Deep Learning Neural network using Tensorflow to recognise the handwritten character in the image.

## Future Scope
Can be used to scan an image of handwritten text and convert into text document.
Can be used to solve scanned image of handwritten mathematical equations.
